🛡️Phishing Detector App

This app helps you detect shady links before you accidentally click on some phishing scam.
It’s built for anyone who wants basic protection without being a tech genius.
And honestly, I’m building it to prove that I understand Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, and App Dev

What It Does rn

* Paste a link → Model tells if it’s shady or not
* Uses machine learning - trained with real phishing + legit URLs
* Simple Android UI made with Jetpack Compose (cause it should look nice even if it's function is basic) 

---

Tools I’m Using

* `pandas` + `numpy` for data preprocessing
* Logistic Regression model for phishing detection
* Planning to convert model to `TFLite` for Android
* Frontend in `Kotlin` using Jetpack Compose

Why I'm Doing This

Because I wanted to do one project that brings together:

* A bit of ML
* A bit of Cybersecurity
* A bit of Android App Dev
  Even though I’m not an expert in any of them yet - I’m learning by doing.

Future Ideas

Once the basic version works, I *might* add:

* DNS and domain checking
* Cloud integration for threat database
* Better UI + link scanner inside the app
  Or maybe I’ll just vibe and build something else — who knows?

Just a girl who’s tired of getting overwhelmed and decided to build something anyway.
